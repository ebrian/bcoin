for a block to be valid and ready to add to the blockchain, it must:
- have a height one larger than the previous
- have a previous hash which matches the previous block's sol_hash
- have a txs_hash which matches the sha256 hash of the transactions (each tx joined by \n)
- have from and to addresses that are in the proper format [0-9a-zA-Z]{44}
- have from and to amts which are positive and in the proper format [0-9]+\.[0-9]{8}
- have from amt which is >= the balance (to sum - from sum) of that address
- have a from address which can be made from base58(sha256(pub key in sig))
- successfully pass an openssl message and signature integrity verification check
  which consists of verifying the transaction contents was signed by a sender's
  private key which is the private key for the public key which the address was derived from
